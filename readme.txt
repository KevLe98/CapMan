Inside the Build folder is the .exe file and Data folders required to play Cap-Man

Use the arrow keys to move the player, and press 'Esc' to quit the application at anytime.

The game analysis document and concept art can be found in the Documents folder.

NOTE: 

Despite being given multiple due date extensions, we barely had the original
"PowerPellet" mechanic to work properly so we excluded it from the final build. 
Otherwise everything else works as intended like the original Pac-Man game.
